## Brief

You are required to create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together, you are creating an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules.

For services #2, #3 and #4 you need to create 2 different implementations, you must be able to demonstrate swapping these implementations out for each other seamlessly, without disrupting the user experience.

### Additional Requirements

* Github webhook for automation
* Testing
* NGINX reverse proxy
* Jenkins Pipeline
* Ansible Configuration Management
* Docker swarm
* Feature Branch version control
